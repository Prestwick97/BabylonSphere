# _StarLife_

#### _An application that allows users to simulate the lifecycle of a star, May 18th, 2020_

#### By _**Patrick S. Delaney**_

### Welcome to the Babylon.js portion of this application!

## Description

_At the moment, within this portion of the application, you can only view the basic built-in public asset animation by Babylon. In this application, users will (eventually) be able to run simulations of a star's lifecycle. Simulations will vary depending on the manipulations made to the star's mass at birth. As well as the timeline._

## Project pivot âœ¨
_Originally, this project was going to be an interactive site build with React and Three.js. However, after some time spent with development errors I decided to use Babylon.js instead of Three.js for animations. The animations have not yet been encorporated into this React application, but they will be at a later date. At this time, the project proposal in the Composition folder is outdated. Thank you!_
